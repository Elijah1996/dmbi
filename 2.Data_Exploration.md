1. For the given data set
    1. Find the mean,mode and median.
    2. Show the boxplot of the data clearly indicating five numbers sumary of data.

Data : 11, 13, 13,  15, 15, 16, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 22, 23, 24, 30, 40, 45, 45, 45, 71, 72, 73, 75


2. Explain different data visualization techniques that can be used in Data Mining



3. WhatDifferent types of attributes in a data mining data set are:

Nominal:
The values of a nominal attribute are just different names, i.e. nominal attributes provide only enough information to distinguish one object from another(=,≠)
Examples: zip codes, employees ID numbers.

Ordinal:
The values of an ordinal attribute provide enough information to order objects(<, >)
Examples: Hardness of minerals, street numbers

Interval:
For interval attributes, the differences between values are meaningful,i.e. a unit of measurement exists(+,-)
Examples: Calendar dates, Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Ratio:
For ration variables, both differences and ratios are meaningful(*,/)
Examples: Temperature in Kelvin, counts, age. 

is text mining ? Explain different approaches to the text mining ?
Text Mining is the procedure of synthesizing information, by analyzing relations, patterns, and rules among textual data-semi structured or unstructured text.
This procedure contains text summarization, text categorization and text clustering.
Text summarization is the procedure to extract its partial content reflection to its whole contents automatically.
Text categorization is the procedure of assigning a category to the text among categories predefined by users.
Text clustering is the procedure of segmenting texts into several clusters, depending on the substantial relevance.
Techniques:

Data mining
Machine learning
Information retrieval
Statistics
Natural –language understanding
Case-based reasoning
Text Mining Approaches:

Keyword based Association Analysis:

Collect sets of keywords or terms that occur frequently together and then find the association or correlation relationship among them.
First preprocess the text data by parsing, stemming, removing stop words, etc.
Then evoke association mining algorithms -Consider each document as a transaction -View a set of keywords in the document as set of items in the transaction.
Term level association mining
No need for human effort in tagging documents. -The number of meaningless results and the execution time is greatly reduced.
Document Classification Analysis:

Automatic document classification:

Automatic classification for the tremendous number of on-line text documents(Web pages, emails, etc)
Text document classification differs from the classification of relational data as document databases are not structured according to attribute-value pairs.
Association-Based Document Classification:

Extract keywords and terms by information retrieval and simple association analysis techniques.
Obtain concept hierarchies of keywords and terms using Available term classes such as WordNet, Expert knowledge.
Classify documents in the training set into class hierarchies.
Apply term association mining method to discover sets of associated terms.
Use the term to maximally distinguish one class of documents from others.
Derive a set of association rules associated with each document class.
Order the classification rule based on their occurrence frequency and discriminative power.
Used the rules to classify new documents.
3. Document Clustering Analysis:

Automatically group related documents based on their contents.
Require no training sets or predetermined taxonomies, generate a taxonomy at runtime,
Major steps:
Preprocessing: Remove stop words, stem, feature extraction.
Hierarchical clustering: Compute similarities applying clustering algorithms.
Slicing: Fan out controls; flatten the tree to configurable number of levels.



4. Describe different types of attributes which may come in Data Mining. Give two example of each type.


Different types of attributes in a data mining data set are:

Nominal:

The values of a nominal attribute are just different names, i.e. nominal attributes provide only enough information to distinguish one object from another(=,≠)

Examples: zip codes, employees ID numbers.

Ordinal:

The values of an ordinal attribute provide enough information to order objects(<, >)

Examples: Hardness of minerals, street numbers

Interval:

For interval attributes, the differences between values are meaningful,i.e. a unit of measurement exists(+,-)

Examples: Calendar dates, Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Ratio:

For ration variables, both differences and ratios are meaningful(*,/)
Examples: Temperature in Kelvin, counts, age.
 
5. Explain different types of distance measures that can be used to compute the distances between two clusters ?

6. Consider the following data points 

12,15,16,16,19,20,21,22,22,25,25,25,25,30,33,33,35,35,35,35,36,40,45,46,52,70
a) What is the mean of the data ? what is the median ?
b) What is the mode of the data ?
c) What is the midrange of the data ?
d) Can you find (roughly ) first quartile and third quartile of the data ? 
e) Show a box plot of the data.

7. Describe the different visualization techniques that can be used in the data mining.

8. What is data exploration ?
Data exploration is the first step in data analysis and typically involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. It is commonly conducted using visual analytics tools, but can also be done in more advanced statistical software, such as R.
